My name Is Jonathan Ryan McGown (I go by Ryan which is my middle name) and I am a 44 year old father of two young daughters currently living in Burlington, VT. From 1996 to 2017 I had a career as an electrician in the Tampa Bay Area of Florida working mostly in the residential sector. In January of 2018, shortly after my first daughter was born, I resigned from the elctrical field to stay home and raise my newborn. My oldest child is approaching school age, so I decided it was time for me to start preparing to return to the workforce. The overall subject of computers in general has interested me since I was very young and my parents purchased me a computer of my very own at the age of 8 years old. Over the subsequent decades I was always immersed in using computers and also built 2 machines by purchasing individual components and using web tutorials to complete the builds. Between 2005 and 2020 I spent countless hours learning to compose music using production and recording software. Other than adding minor alterations to custom Myspace page templates in the mid 2000s I had very little experience or knowledge with HTML or any type of coding. I chose to enroll in the MIT coding course since the school is so highly regarded and respected and since it's name and reputation speak for themselves.
