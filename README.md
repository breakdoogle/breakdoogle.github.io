This is my first attempt at building a website designed to showcase the information and skills I have learned in the MIT coding course up to ths date. There are several items I would like to change in the future once I've acquired the knowledge to do so icluding:
1) making the navbar visible on all pages and not just the home page so the browser's "Back" button won't need to be used everytime the navbar is used.
2) adding style to the links in the navbar.
3) centering the video on the homepage in the very center of the screen and not just centered at the top of the screen.
